year % 4 == 0 means "Is the year divisible by 4?"

If yes, it might be a leap year. Check more.

Now check: is the year divisible by 100?

If yes, it's a special case → might NOT be a leap year.

If it's also divisible by 400, it is a leap year.

If divisible by 100 but not by 400 → Not a leap year

If divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 → Leap year ✅

If the year is not divisible by 4 → Not a leap year ❌


CODE -- 

year = int(input('Which year you want to check'))
if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print('Leap year')
    else:
      print('Not leap year')
  else:
    print('Leap year')
else:
  print('Not leap year')


OUTPUT --
