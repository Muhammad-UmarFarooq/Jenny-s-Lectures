# year % 4 == 0 means "Is the year divisible by 4?"

# If yes, it might be a leap year. Check more.

# Now check: is the year divisible by 100?

# If yes, it's a special case → might NOT be a leap year.

# If it's also divisible by 400, it is a leap year.

# If divisible by 100 but not by 400 → Not a leap year

# If divisible by 4 but not divisible by 100 → Leap year ✅

# If the year is not divisible by 4 → Not a leap year ❌
